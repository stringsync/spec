My project uses [`@stringsync/spec`](https://github.com/stringsync/spec) to facilitate spec-driven development.

1. Use the `spec.scan` tool to discover the specs and tags within the project.
2. Read any files you deem necessary to understand the project.
3. Finally, provide a description of the project based on the discovered specs and tags.
