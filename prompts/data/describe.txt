My project uses [`@stringsync/spec`](https://github.com/stringsync/spec) to facilitate spec-driven development.

1. Review how the library is intended to be used by reading the [AGENTS.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stringsync/spec/refs/heads/master/AGENTS.md) documentation.
2. Use the `spec.scan` tool to discover the specs and tags within the project.
3. Read any files you deem necessary to understand the project.
4. Finally, provide a description of the project based on the discovered specs and tags.
