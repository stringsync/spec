I want you to implement the createEvent CUJ from @/examples/whencanyoumeetme/cujs.spec.ts You have the following commands that you can run in a shell:

<commands>

Read the CUJs as a markdown file.

```sh
intentx md examples/whencanyoumeetme/cujs.spec.ts
```

Detect intent events.

```sh
intentx scan examples/whencanyoumeetme/tsconfig.json
```

</commands>

Only make changes in @/examples/whencanyoumeetme.
