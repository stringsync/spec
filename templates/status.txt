Evaluate implementation progress for each spec in the selector scope `{{selector}}` and report a concise status.

1. Resolve scope
   - Use the `spec.show` command to examine the selector `{{selector}}`.

2. Gather evidence
   - Locate related files and TODOs for each spec from the `spec.show` output.
   - Skim implementation sites for obvious stubs, partial logic, or completed code.
   - Consider presence/absence of minimal tests or checks (if available).

3. Rate each spec
   - Use the following rubric:
     - ðŸ”´ red â€” no scaffold or TODO present; TODO exists but no meaningful implementation started; or the spec ambiguously conflicts with another
     - ðŸŸ¡ yellow â€” scaffold or partial implementation exists but acceptance criteria are only partially met (work remains).
     - ðŸŸ¢ green â€” implementation appears to meet the spec acceptance criteria, with no obvious gaps.
   - If ambiguous, prefer ðŸŸ¡ **yellow** and add a brief comment.

4. Output results
   - Produce a newline-separated list using this format:
     - `<spec-name> [red|yellow|green]: <optional comment>`
   - Keep comments short (up to two sentences). Include code location pointers like `file:line` when helpful. You can reuse the locations from the `spec.show` command.
