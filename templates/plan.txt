Generate implementation scaffolds (no business logic) from specs for the selector `{{selector}}`.

Follow these steps to complete the plan workflow:

1. Enumerate specs
  - Identify all specs within the selector `{{selector}}`.
  - Compare the current codebase to the specs and identify which features are missing or incomplete.
  - Explicitly list the gaps between existing implementation and the requirements in the spec and use that to inform the scaffold.

2. Determine placement
  - For each spec, determine the appropriate file, class, or function where the implementation belongs.

3. Create skeletal code structure
  - Generate a skeleton at the correct location.
  - Keep file and module names consistent with the spec naming.

4. Insert TODO comment
  - Use the format: `// spec(<spec-name>): TODO - <details>`.
  - Place it as close as possible to where the implementation should go.

5. Provide acceptance criteria
  - Ensure the TODO includes clear acceptance criteria describing what needs to be built.
  - Make it understandable enough that another agent or developer can complete it.

6. Keep scaffolds minimal
  - Do not implement business logic.
  - Only create signatures, wiring, and placeholders needed for the scaffold.

7. Repeat for all specs
  - Apply this process to every spec in scope until all required stubs are generated.
