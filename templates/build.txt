# build

Implement existing TODO tags derived from specs within the given selectorâ€™s scope.

## Inputs
- selector: {{selector}}  
  (Either a module name like `foo` or a spec name like `foo.bar`.)

## Objective
Locate `TODO` tags tied to spec names under **{{selector}}** and complete them. Replace placeholder tag content with working code that satisfies the associated spec content.

## Rules
- Only implement TODOs that reference a valid spec name.
- Keep changes minimal and focused; avoid broad refactors.
- Update or remove the TODO tag once completed.
- If behavior is ambiguous, surface a question rather than guessing.

## Method
1. Scan for `TODO(spec-name)` tags within {{selector}}.
2. For each TODO, read the spec content and acceptance criteria.
3. Implement the missing code to satisfy the spec.
4. Update the file by removing or resolving the TODO tag.

## Output Format
Markdown with:

### Worklog
A chronological list of TODOs addressed and rationale for changes.

### Patches
Unified diffs for all modifications.

### Results
- Remaining TODOs, if any.
- Open questions or clarifications still needed.
