Implement TODOs derived from specs within the given selector’s scope for selector `{{selector}}`.

Follow these steps to complete the build workflow:

1. Resolve scope
   - Use the `spec.show` command to examine the selector `{{selector}}`.
   - Limit work to files that contain TODOs referencing one of these spec names.

2. Find actionable TODOs
   - Scan code for TODO tags that reference spec names. Accept any of these forms placed near the target code:
     - `// spec(<spec-name>): TODO - <details>`
     - `// TODO(<spec-name>): <details>`
     - `/* spec(<spec-name>): TODO - <details> */`
   - If a TODO does not reference a valid spec name in scope, **do not implement it**; record it under “Results → Remaining TODOs”.

3. Read the spec and define acceptance
   - Open the referenced spec and extract concrete acceptance criteria.
   - If criteria are missing or ambiguous, create a minimal clarification question; **do not guess**. Record it under “Results → Open questions”.

4. Implement minimal, targeted changes
   - Make the smallest change that satisfies the spec and acceptance criteria.
   - Avoid broad refactors; leave structure as-is unless required to satisfy the spec.
   - Do not introduce unrelated features or alter external behavior beyond the spec.

5. Keep scaffolds minimal
   - Prefer focused functions, small conditionals, or wiring to existing components.
   - Do not add extra abstractions, utilities, or dead code.

6. Update the TODO tag
   - When the spec requirement is satisfied, remove the TODO tag or replace it with a succinct reference comment showing the implemented spec name, e.g.:
     - `// spec(<spec-name>): done`
   - If partially complete, keep the TODO with a short note of what remains.

7. Validate locally
   - Run existing tests or quick checks if available.
   - If no tests exist, add **only** the smallest sanity checks needed to demonstrate the change when appropriate (e.g., a minimal assertion or example).

8. Prepare output artifacts
   - Produce **Markdown** with three sections:
     - ### Worklog — chronological list of TODOs addressed, spec names, and short rationale.
     - ### Patches — unified diffs for each modified file.
     - ### Results — remaining TODOs (with locations/specs) and any open questions.

9. Repeat
   - Iterate over all actionable TODOs in scope until none remain or only blocked/ambiguous items are left.
